# The 100 Club
Exploring the 100% Fresh Club from Rotten Tomatoes to uncover the secrets of "perfect" films

## Idea:
🚀 How to Elevate This Project to “Wow” Level
1. Go Full Stack Data Science
Break it into these phases and build each out:

Data Collection: Scrape RT or another source using requests, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium. Get critic scores, audience scores, review counts, release years, genres, directors, runtimes, and more.

Data Wrangling: Clean the data using pandas. Normalize decades, standardize title formats, handle missing data, and prep for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis: Your ideas are fantastic:

Audience vs Critic score discrepancies.

How many reviews each movie has—does review count correlate with the score?

Decade-by-decade breakdown: Is "perfect" film more common in certain eras?

Data Visualization: Use matplotlib, seaborn, or even Plotly for interactive charts.

Line graphs by decade.

Scatterplots: review count vs. score discrepancy.

Heatmaps of genres or directors with perfect scores.

2. Bonus: Sentiment Analysis
Scrape a sample of audience reviews and perform NLP-based sentiment analysis using TextBlob or VADER.

Compare sentiment polarity with the actual numeric audience score—does it align?

3. Build an Interactive Dashboard (Next-Level Resume Boost)
Use Streamlit or Dash to build a clean, clickable web app that:

Lets users explore the dataset interactively.

Shows trends by genre, year, audience/critic divide.

Includes a "Controversial Pick of the Day" (biggest audience-critic gap).

4. Add a Narrative Layer
Include a short write-up or even a “thesis” in your dashboard:

“Do 100% Scores Actually Reflect Universal Acclaim, or Just Selective Sampling?”

Bring in your interest in philosophy and storytelling—what does it mean for a film to be perfect?

5. Make It Collaborative or Expandable
Create a way for users to submit additional films they think deserve 100% status and compare them to the RT list.

Optionally, compare RT data with IMDB or Letterboxd (public ratings vs critics).
